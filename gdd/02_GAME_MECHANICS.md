# Game Mechanics

This section details the various systems and mechanics that make up the gameplay of Farmhand. The primary mechanic is the economy, with all other systems serving as a means to interact with it.

## 1. The Economy: Your Battlefield

The economy is the core of the game. It is a living system that players must learn to master.

### 1.1. The Commodities Market & Selling

In Farmhand, there is no physical "market" location. Instead, the "market" is an abstract economic system that governs the value of goods. Selling is a direct UI action.

*   **The Selling Process:** To sell an item, the player selects it from their inventory. A pop-up appears showing the current price, and allows the player to select a quantity and confirm the sale. The money is instantly added to their account.
*   **The Commodities Market:** This is the system of fluctuating prices.
    *   **Price Fluctuations:** Prices for all sellable goods change daily based on a randomized algorithm. The key to success is buying the means of production when prices are low and selling the resulting goods when prices are high.
    *   **Price Events:** The game will announce special price events at the start of a day. These are significant, temporary shifts in the value of a commodity (e.g., "Tomato prices are skyrocketing!"). These events are major opportunities for profit or loss.
    *   **Multiplayer Market Dynamics:** In multiplayer, the commodities market is a shared entity. When one player sells a large volume of a commodity, it drives the price down for everyone. This creates a competitive and collaborative economic environment where players must react to each other's strategies.

### 1.2. The Shop: A Place to Buy

The Shop is a dedicated location in the game where players go to purchase items. It is a one-way transaction; no selling can be done here. The Shop is where players make their initial investments.

*   **Buying "Stock":** Purchasing seeds and cows is the primary way to invest in future production. The cost of these items is fixed, but the potential return is variable, depending on when you sell the resulting products.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Purchasing tools, upgrades, and land are capital expenditures designed to increase the efficiency and scale of your production engine.

### 1.3. Loans: High-Risk Capital

Players can take out loans for a quick influx of cash.

*   **Leverage:** Loans allow players to leverage their capital, enabling them to make larger investments than they could otherwise afford.
*   **Interest:** Loans come with daily interest payments, adding a layer of risk. A poorly timed investment made with a loan can lead to significant debt.

## 2. Farming: Your Production Engine

Farming is the primary method for producing the commodities you will trade on the market. It is a system to be optimized for maximum efficiency and profit.

*   **Crops as Assets:** Each crop is an asset with a cost to produce (seed price, time, and labor) and a variable sale price. Players must choose which crops to invest in based on their analysis of the market.
*   **The Field as a Factory:** The farm is the player's factory floor. Expanding the farm and optimizing its layout is key to scaling up production.
*   **Tools for Efficiency:** Upgrading tools is not just about making farming easier; it's about increasing the return on investment. An upgraded scythe harvests more from a single plot, directly increasing the yield of an investment. An upgraded watering can reduces the time-cost of production.

## 3. Animal Husbandry: The Breeding Meta-Game

Cows are a special class of asset that players can invest in for long-term, high-value returns through a genetic collection meta-game.

*   **Cows as Bonds:** Compared to crops, cows are a more stable investment. They have a higher initial cost but provide a steady stream of daily revenue (milk). The value of their output can be increased through care (hugging) and proper feeding.
*   **The Breeding System:** The core of animal husbandry is the breeding system.
    *   **Colors and Bloodlines:** Cows come in a variety of standard colors (e.g., white, brown, blue, etc.). Each cow has a "bloodline" that genetically tracks all the colors of its ancestors.
    *   **Inheritance:** When two cows of opposite genders are placed in the breeding pen, they will eventually produce an offspring. This new cow inherits the combined bloodlines of both its parents.
    *   **The Rainbow Cow:** The ultimate goal of the breeding system is to create a "Rainbow Cow." This is achieved by strategically breeding cows together to create a single cow that has every standard color in its bloodline.
    *   **Rainbow Milk:** Rainbow Cows are extremely valuable because they produce "Rainbow Milk," a premium commodity that sells for a very high price. Achieving a Rainbow Cow provides a significant and steady source of income, representing the ultimate payoff for a long-term investment strategy.

## 4. Crafting: Creating High-Value Goods

Crafting is the process of turning basic commodities into more advanced, higher-value products. This is analogous to creating complex financial instruments.

*   **The Workshop & Cellar:** These are the player's R&D labs and finishing factories.
*   **Value-Added Products:** A bottle of wine is worth more than the grapes and yeast used to make it. Cooking recipes turn basic crops into more valuable dishes. Crafting allows players to access higher tiers of the market.
*   **Risk and Reward:** Crafting requires a larger upfront investment of time and resources. However, the potential payoff from selling artisanal goods is much higher than selling raw commodities.

## 5. Progression: Your Economic Reputation

The progression system reflects the player's growth as a market tycoon.

*   **Experience as Market Clout:** Gaining experience and leveling up unlocks access to new markets (new seeds and recipes) and more advanced production techniques (tool upgrades).
*   **Achievements as Trophies:** Achievements mark significant economic milestones, celebrating the player's successes as a trader.
