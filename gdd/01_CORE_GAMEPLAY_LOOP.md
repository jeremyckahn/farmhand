# Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay in Farmhand is a cycle of strategic economic decisions, with farming as the primary means of executing those decisions. A successful player will internalize the "buy low, sell high" principle and adopt a strategic mindset that can be broken down into several approaches:

## 1. Market Analysis: The Strategic Mindset

The first and most important strategy is to constantly analyze the market.

*   **Check Prices:** The player reviews the current market prices for all commodities.
*   **Identify Opportunities:** The player looks for goods with low prices (a good time to "buy" or produce) and goods with high prices (a good time to sell).
*   **Anticipate Events:** The player is informed of any upcoming price events, which can drastically change the value of certain goods. This information is crucial for planning.

## 2. Investment & Production: The "Buy Low" Strategy

Based on their market analysis, the player should adopt a strategy of investing their capital in producing commodities they believe will be profitable.

*   **Purchase Seeds:** The player buys seeds for crops that are either currently undervalued or are expected to rise in price. This is the equivalent of buying a low-cost stock.
*   **Manage Production:** The player engages in the farming activities required to grow their "stock": tilling, planting, watering, and protecting their crops. This is the "work" required to mature their investment.

## 3. Holding & Waiting: The Patience Strategy

Once an investment is made, a player's strategy may involve waiting for it to mature and for market conditions to become favorable.

*   **Nurture Assets:** The player continues to care for their crops and animals.
*   **Monitor the Market:** The player keeps a close eye on the market, waiting for the optimal moment to sell. This approach is a test of patience and risk management.

## 4. Selling High: The Profit-Taking Strategy

This is the payoff. The player's strategy should be to sell their commodities when the price is high to maximize their return on investment.

*   **Timing the Sale:** The player must decide on the best day to sell. Do they sell now for a guaranteed profit, or risk waiting another day in the hopes of an even higher price?
*   **Liquidate Assets:** The player sells their harvested crops and other goods, converting their tangible assets back into cash.

## 5. Re-investment & Growth: The "Compounding" Strategy

A forward-thinking player will adopt a strategy of using profits from successful sales to expand their economic engine.

*   **Increase Production Capacity:** The player can purchase more land, allowing them to produce more commodities at once.
*   **Improve Efficiency:** The player can upgrade their tools and infrastructure (like sprinklers) to reduce the labor cost of producing goods, increasing their profit margins.
*   **Diversify Portfolio:** The player can unlock new types of crops and animals, allowing them to diversify their "portfolio" and mitigate risk.

This strategic cycle repeats, with the player using their growing knowledge of the market and their expanding farm to generate ever-increasing profits.
