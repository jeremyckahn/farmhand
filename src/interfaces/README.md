# Interfaces

This directory contains class objects that are meant to serve as [interfaces](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)>). Ideally JSDoc or TypeScript would be used to achieve a more proper interface/implementation system. However, TypeScript is not currently available in this project and JSDoc doesn't have good editor integration for interfaces. So, classes with empty method definitions are used instead.
