# Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay in Farmhand is a cycle of strategic economic decisions, with farming as the primary means of executing those decisions. The loop is focused on the "buy low, sell high" principle.

## 1. Analyze the Market (The Strategy Phase)

The first and most important step in the loop is to analyze the market.

*   **Check Prices:** The player reviews the current market prices for all commodities.
*   **Identify Opportunities:** The player looks for goods with low prices (a good time to "buy" or produce) and goods with high prices (a good time to sell).
*   **Anticipate Events:** The player is informed of any upcoming price events, which can drastically change the value of certain goods. This information is crucial for planning.

## 2. Invest & Produce (The "Buy Low" Phase)

Based on their market analysis, the player invests their capital in producing commodities they believe will be profitable.

*   **Purchase Seeds:** The player buys seeds for crops that are either currently undervalued or are expected to rise in price. This is the equivalent of buying a low-cost stock.
*   **Manage Production:** The player engages in the farming activities required to grow their "stock": tilling, planting, watering, and protecting their crops. This is the "work" required to mature their investment.

## 3. Hold & Wait (The "Holding" Phase)

Once an investment is made, the player must wait for it to mature and for the market conditions to be favorable.

*   **Nurture Assets:** The player continues to care for their crops and animals.
*   **Monitor the Market:** The player keeps a close eye on the market, waiting for the optimal moment to sell. This phase is a test of patience and risk management.

## 4. Sell High (The "Sell High" Phase)

This is the payoff. The player sells their commodities when the price is high to maximize their return on investment.

*   **Timing the Sale:** The player must decide on the best day to sell. Do they sell now for a guaranteed profit, or risk waiting another day in the hopes of an even higher price?
*   **Liquidate Assets:** The player sells their harvested crops and other goods, converting their tangible assets back into cash.

## 5. Re-invest & Grow (The "Growth" Phase)

The profits from successful sales are used to expand the player's economic engine.

*   **Increase Production Capacity:** The player can purchase more land, allowing them to produce more commodities at once.
*   **Improve Efficiency:** The player can upgrade their tools and infrastructure (like sprinklers) to reduce the labor cost of producing goods, increasing their profit margins.
*   **Diversify Portfolio:** The player can unlock new types of crops and animals, allowing them to diversify their "portfolio" and mitigate risk.

This loop repeats, with the player using their growing knowledge of the market and their expanding farm to generate ever-increasing profits.
