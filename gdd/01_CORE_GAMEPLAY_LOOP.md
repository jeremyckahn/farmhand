# Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay in Farmhand is built around a simple yet addictive core loop. This loop is designed to be easy to understand for new players, while also offering enough depth to keep experienced players engaged. The loop can be broken down into the following stages:

## 1. Plant & Grow (The Work Phase)

This is the foundation of the game. In this phase, the player performs the essential tasks of a farmer:

*   **Prepare the Land:** The player uses tools like the hoe and shovel to till the soil and prepare it for planting.
*   **Plant Seeds:** The player purchases or uses seeds from their inventory to plant crops in their fields.
*   **Nurture the Crops:** The player must water their crops daily to ensure they grow. They can also use fertilizers to speed up growth or gain other benefits.
*   **Protect the Farm:** The player must deal with threats like weeds, which can choke out crops, and crows, which can eat them. Tools like the scythe and scarecrows are used to mitigate these threats.

## 2. Harvest & Collect (The Reward Phase)

After a certain number of in-game days, the player's crops will be ready for harvest. This is the payoff for their hard work:

*   **Harvesting:** The player uses a scythe to harvest their mature crops, which are then added to their inventory. The yield of the harvest can be increased by upgrading the scythe.
*   **Collecting Animal Products:** If the player owns cows, they can collect milk from them daily. The quality and quantity of milk can be influenced by how well the cows are cared for.

## 3. Sell & Earn (The Economic Phase)

Once the player has a collection of goods, they can sell them to earn money:

*   **The Market:** The player can sell their crops, animal products, and other items at the in-game market.
*   **Price Fluctuations:** The market is dynamic, with prices for goods changing daily. There are also random price events that can dramatically increase or decrease the value of certain items. This encourages players to be strategic about when they sell their goods.
*   **Multiplayer Impact:** In multiplayer games, the collective actions of all players can influence the market, creating a shared economic environment.

## 4. Upgrade & Expand (The Progression Phase)

The money earned from selling goods is used to improve and expand the farm:

*   **Buying New Seeds and Items:** The player can purchase a wide variety of new seeds and items from the shop, allowing them to grow different crops and access new gameplay mechanics.
*   **Upgrading Tools:** The player can upgrade their tools at the workshop, making them more efficient. For example, an upgraded watering can can water multiple plots at once.
*   **Expanding the Farm:** The player can purchase new fields to expand their farming operations.
*   **Investing in Infrastructure:** The player can purchase items like sprinklers to automate watering, or hugging machines to improve cow happiness.

## 5. The Loop Repeats

This core loop forms the backbone of the Farmhand experience. Each cycle of the loop allows the player to become more efficient, unlock new possibilities, and grow their farm into a larger and more impressive enterprise. The game's day/night cycle and seasonal changes add variety to this loop, ensuring that there's always something new to do and see.
