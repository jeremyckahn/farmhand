Hi, you're playing **Farmhand**! This is an open source game project created by [Jeremy Kahn](https://github.com/jeremyckahn). The project has evolved over time and is now developed with the support of [a community of contributors](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

[![Source code](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label)](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/714539345050075176?label=farmhand+discord)](https://discord.gg/6cHEZ9H) [![@farmhandgame](https://badgen.net/twitter/follow/farmhandgame)](https://twitter.com/farmhandgame) [![r/FarmhandGame](https://img.shields.io/reddit/subreddit-subscribers/FarmhandGame?style=social)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FarmhandGame/)

Farmhand is a resource management game that puts a farm in your hand. It is designed to be both desktop and mobile-friendly and fun for 30 seconds or 30 minutes at a time. Can you build a thriving farming business? Give it a try and find out!

This project has been in development since 2018. **Farmhand will always remain completely free to play**.

### How to play

The goal of Farmhand is to make money by buying, growing, harvesting, and then selling crops. Keep an eye on prices though, because they go up and down every day! The best farmers buy seeds for a low price and sell them for a high price.

If you can master the art of the harvest, there's no limit to how profitable you can become! Every farmer starts with a $${STANDARD_LOAN_AMOUNT} loan from the bank. If you run out of money, you can always take out another loan. Be careful though, because the bank takes a portion of your sales until the debt is repaid. You can access your bank account in the menu.

### ![Animated Scarecrow](${items['scarecrow-animated']}) Looking for more farming fun? ![Animated Scarecrow](${items['scarecrow-animated']})

The Farmhand team is working on a brand new game for you to play: **[Farmhand Go!](https://rainbowcow-studio.itch.io/farmhand-go)**

**Farmhand Go!** is a complementary game to the one you're playing right now. It's a more active take on the Farmhand concept, with days passing in real time and crows that you need to click/tap to defend against. If you like growing, harvesting, and selling crops in Farmhand, you're going to love **Farmhand Go!**

The Farmhand game you're playing now is still under active development, so don't be concerned about it being abandonded by the team. We just love exploring new ideas and making fun games!

### Online multiplayer

You can play Farmhand online with others! Online play is totally free and anonymous.

To play online, flip the "Play online" toggle in the menu. You'll be connected to the **global** room by default, but you can select another room to play in if you'd like. If you select a room that doesn't exist, it will automatically be created for you. You can then tell others to meet you in that room.

Online play works just like offline play, except that the fluctuating market values are shared among everyone playing in the room with you. Additionally, market values are affected by your choices when you end a farm day:

* Buying seeds or harvesting crops raises their respective values

* Selling items (seeds or harvested crops) or harvesting seeds lowers their respective values

You'll see a notification explaining how you affected the market when you end the farm day. Because room market values are shared, **your buy/sell/harvest decisions affect others** when they join the room or end their farm day. Time your actions right to take advantage of market trends and gain the competitive edge over other online farmers!

As an added bonus for playing online, **you'll get free money** a few times every minute while connected to a room. The more people that are connected, the more you'll get. Invite your friends to the room and to increase the bonus for everyone!
